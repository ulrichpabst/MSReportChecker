# MSReportChecker

**Real-Time HRMS Report Validation Directly Inside Microsoft Word**

MSReportChecker is a standalone Microsoft Word Add-in that automatically detects and evaluates High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) data within Word documents.

It validates formatting, extracts molecular formulas, calculates exact masses, and flags potential inconsistencies between reported and theoretical values â€” all in real time, without the need for copy-pasting or external software.

This tool is intended to support chemists, academic authors, and peer reviewers by ensuring HRMS data quality and adherence to reporting standards, particularly in manuscripts prepared for chemistry journals.


## Installation

MSReportChecker is a Microsoft Word Add-in available for both **macOS** and **Windows**. It can be used in two ways:

- âœ… **Recommended**: Load the Add-in from GitHub Pages (auto-updating, zero setup)
- ðŸ’» **Offline**: Use a local installation via a self-hosted server (fully local, no network access)

> ðŸ’¡ Microsoft Word on Linux is not officially supported, but if you're managing to run it there, you probably know how to make the Add-in work too.

```
2.	Open Microsoft Word
3.	Select MS Report Checker from the Home ribbon tab
4.	Click Analyze Document in the taskpane to scan for HRMS reports
5.	Results are presented in a table with tooltips and colored status icons
